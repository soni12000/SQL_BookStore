In this project, I worked with three CSV files (Books, Customers, and Orders) to retrieve, filter, and summarize data using SQL queries. By leveraging SQL, I was able to:

 - Retrieve book details based on genres, publication years, and stock levels.

 - Analyze customer orders, including high-value purchases and order trends.

 - Calculate total revenue, best-selling books, and most valuable customers.

 - Perform advanced queries to identify top authors, frequently ordered books, and city-wise customer spending patterns.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐆𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝:

 - The most frequently ordered book.
 - The top 3 most expensive books in the Fantasy genre.
 - The total stock remaining after fulfilling all orders.
 - Customer locations where spending exceeded $30. and many more...
